Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Because Data Structures are building Blocks of many things we want to do in Programming. If we know the use for each Data Structure, and its weakness and strong points then we can easily solve problems.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures? Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Traversal, Sorting, Merging.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively? Compiler Design, Operating System, Database mangement System, Statistical Analysis Package, Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artifical Intelligence, Simulation
what is an Array? Is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold Constant number of values of the same type.By Declaring an Array, memory space is allocated for values of a particular type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList? Array is a fixed length data structure, while ArrayList is a variable length collection Class. You cannot store primitives in ArrayList. It can only contain Objects.On the other hand Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.
what is LinkedList? Is Linear Data Structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a seperate Object with a Data part and address part.
How is an Array different from Linked List? Both can be used to store linear data of similar types. An Array is the data structure contains a collection of similar type of data elements, where LinkedList is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as Nodes.
what is queue? Is an Interface available in Java.util package and extends Java.util.Collection interface. Its a collection of ordered elements, but it performs insert and remove operations differently.
what is stack? Is an area of memory that holds all local variables. Stack is always referred in LIFO. (Last-In-First-Out)
what is FIFO and LIFO? FIFO( First,In First,Out) LIFO (Last,In, First,Out)
what is the order of complexity? Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Smooth Sort, Bubble Sort.
what is the best case to search an element from an array? Selection Sorting.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array? Quick Sort.
what is tree in data structure? Is a non-linear Data Structure, A trr can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and  zero or one or more subtrees.
what is graph in data structure? Is a non-linear data Structure, Consisting of nodes and edges. graphs are used to represent networks.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap? HashMap allows null values as key and value, where HashTable doesnt allow nulls. HashMap is non Synchronized, and HashTable is Synchronized.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model. RDBMS: Array of Structures. Network Data Model: Graph. Hierarchical Data Model: .
How HashMap works in java? We put () and get() method for storing and retrieving object from HshMap.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs? Is thrown to indicate that we are trying to acess array element with an illegal index. it occurs when the index is either negitive or greater than or equal to the size of the Array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array? You can do Manually, Array.copyof(), System.arraycopy(), Object.clone()
What is difference between an array and a linked list? Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. While, a LinkedList is a data structure which contains a sequence of the elements where each element is linked to its next element.
What is DFS and BFS? DFS is breadth First Search and DFS is depth First Search. These are two algorithms used for traversing and searching a node in a graph.
What is Recursion? Is a basic programming technique you can use in Java. Its the use of procedure subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself in step having a termination condition.
What are linear and non linear data Structures? A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached. Arrays, Linked lists are examples of Linear. Non-Linear Data Structures is attached to several other data items in a way that is specific for reflecting relationships. The data items are not arranged in a sequential structure.Examples are Trees, and Graphs.
What is Big-(O)-notation? Is used to descibe the performance or compexity of an algorithm.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity? Selection, Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
